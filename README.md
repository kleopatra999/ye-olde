Ye Olde
=======

This repository serves as a way to report outdated information about Perl 6. 

The primary goals are to provide a place for people to:

* report outdated information about Perl 6 by creating [issues](/perl6/ye-olde/issues)

* provide links to more accurate information by commenting on issues 

* track communication with the owner of the page requesting that it be updated

* avoid duplicate attempts to contact the owner

This repo is primarily for tracking issues outside of the "perl6.org" domain (since things inside perl6.org already have their own trackers).

Creating Issues
===============

The title of the issue should begin with the URL of the page that contains the
outdated information, without the http/https URL scheme prefix.

Only one issue should be created per URL.

How You Can Help
================

* add comments on issues giving links to more accurate information.

* help determine the right person to contact in cases where that's not clear.
 
* contact the owner of the page with a gentle request that it be updated, perhaps simply with a note and a link to the issue. If you do attempt to contact the owner, please add the author-contacted label and a comment.

Resolutions
===========

Likely resolutions:

* The owner of the page replaces the outdated information with accurate information: close the issue.

* The owner of the page deletes the outdated information: close the issue.

* The owner of the page adds a note to the page point out that it's outou with a link to the corresponding [issue](/perl6/ye-olde/issues): close the issue.

* The owner of the page can't be determined, or is unresponsive or unhelpful: leave the issue open.

Crazy Ideas
===========

It would be possible to implement a browser extension to automatically inform people when they're looking at a web page with outdated information.

Similarly, a browser extension or other kind of utility, could simplify the creation of an issue to report outdated information as it's encountered, and avoid duplicate reports.
