Ye Olde
=======

This repository serves as a way to report out-dated information about Perl 6.

The primary goals are to provide a place for people to:

* report out-dated information about Perl 6 by creating [issues](/perl6/ye-olde/issues)

* provide links to more accurate information by commenting on issues 

* track communication with the owner of the page requesting that it be updated

Issues
======

The title of the issue should be the absolute URL of the page that contains the
outdated information, without the URL scheme prefix.

Only one issue should be created per URL.

* create an issue with the URL of the page

* add comments with links to more accurate information

* contact the owner of the page requesting that it be updated, at least with a note and a link to the issue.

Resolutions
===========

Likely resolutions:

* The owner of the page replaces the out-dated information with accurate information: close the issue.

* The owner of the page deletes the out-dated information: close the issue.

* The owner of the page adds a note to the article pointing to the corresponding [issues](/perl6/ye-olde/issues): close the issue.

* The owner of the page is unresponsive or unhelpful: leave the issue open.
